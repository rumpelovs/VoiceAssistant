## Why do I want to create my voice assistant?

One of the main reasons why I strive to create my own voice assistant is that existing assistants, such as Siri or Alice, face a number of problems. For example, they may be limited in functionality or have limited understanding of natural language. My goal is to develop a voice assistant that will have broader capabilities and abilities.

I believe that involving more people in the development of this project can lead to the creation of interesting and useful features for the voice assistant. Collective intelligence and diverse ideas can help expand its capabilities and make it a more convenient and efficient tool for users.

My motivation is to offer an alternative to existing voice assistants that takes into account and corrects their shortcomings. I want to create a voice assistant that will better understand and respond to user requests, have greater functionality, and be more intuitive to use.

I invite everyone who shares my motivation and is interested in voice assistant development to join this project. Together, we can create an innovative solution that meets the needs of users and offers new possibilities in the field of voice interfaces.
